Guide for using the helper function I am creating

```{r}
source("~/.staphopia_logon.R")
db <- staphopia_logon()
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
