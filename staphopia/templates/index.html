                        <p class="indent">
                            Staphopia is a database of information about the 
                            genomes of the bacterial pathogen <em>Staphylococcus 
                            aureus</em>. Life-threatening Methicillin-resistant 
                            <em>S. aureus</em> (MRSA) infections strike across 
                            our society, both in the community and hospital 
                            settings. In the past 3-4 years whole genome shotgun 
                            sequencing of clinical isolates is becoming common, 
                            as technology improvements have reduced the cost 
                            of producing genetic data.

                            provide rapid analysis of whole-genome data with 
                            the aim of producing useful <em>S. aureus</em>-

                            resistance and virulence gene profiles. Staphopia 
                            was designed to be used by people not expert in 
                            genomics.

                            We are currently developing the beta version of the website.  
                            In later updates we will allow users to submit their own data 
                            to our pipeline as well as a number of additional features. 
                            The main genomes page (currently displaying the results of 
                            analysis of more than 6,000 publicly available <em>S. aureus</em> 
                            projects downloaded from the NCBI SRA website) allows users to 
                            search the genomes based on attributes such as resistance genes.
